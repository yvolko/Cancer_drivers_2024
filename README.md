# Identification of new cancer driver genes and associated cellular pathways in high-level amplification regions of genome
The project is done by Iurii Slepov and Yulia Volkova.
Project supervisor: Andrey Yurchenko, PhD.
## Background
Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is circular DNA outside of chromosomes. It has been often found in different types of cancers. Many known oncogenes reside within ecDNA. Moreover, ecDNA is often present in high copy number in tumor cells and increased expression of genes located in the ecDNA is observed. Maintaining many copies shows that this feature states under positive selection. We use high-amplification regions from different cancer types samples to estimate how many regions have known oncogenes and search for new oncogenes in the regions where no known oncogenes are present.
